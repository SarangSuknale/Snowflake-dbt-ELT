                This intermediate model enriches Yodlee account data with derived balance
                metrics, credit utilization calculations, account age attributes, and
                aggregation freshness indicators. Each row represents a single financial
                account owned by a user and is designed to support downstream account
                monitoring, credit usage analysis, and data freshness reporting.
