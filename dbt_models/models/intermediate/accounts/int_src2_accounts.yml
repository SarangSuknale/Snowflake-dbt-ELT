                This intermediate model enriches Source 2 account data with derived balance
                metrics, credit utilization calculations, account age attributes, and
                data freshness indicators. Each row represents a single financial account
                owned by a user and is designed to support downstream account monitoring,
                credit usage analysis, and data freshness reporting.
